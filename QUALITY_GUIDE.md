# YouTube Downloader - Quality Issues Guide

## 🎯 Why Video Quality is Inconsistent

### Common Reasons:

1. **YouTube Source Quality Varies**
   - Not all videos are uploaded in high quality
   - Older videos may only have 480p or lower
   - Live streams often have variable quality

2. **Video Type Affects Quality**
   - Music videos: Usually 1080p available
   - User uploads: Often 720p or lower  
   - Lyric videos: May be lower quality
   - Audio-only content: Results in small file sizes

3. **YouTube's Availability**
   - Some qualities may be geo-restricted
   - YouTube may limit access to higher qualities
   - Server load can affect available formats

## 🔧 How to Get Consistent Better Quality

### 1. **Use "Best Available" Setting**
```
🔴 Best Available (1080p/720p) - Recommended for highest quality
```

### 2. **Check Video Quality Before Downloading**
The app now shows available qualities for each video.

### 3. **Quality Selection Strategy:**
- **For Music Videos:** Use "Best Available" - usually 1080p
- **For Older Content:** Use "High Quality (720p)" as fallback
- **For Long Videos:** Use "Standard Quality (480p)" to save space
- **For Audio Content:** Use "Audio Only (MP3)"

## 📊 Expected File Sizes by Quality:

| Quality | Typical Size (3-4 min video) | Description |
|---------|------------------------------|-------------|
| 1080p   | 50-100MB                    | Full HD |
| 720p    | 25-50MB                     | HD |
| 480p    | 10-25MB                     | Standard |
| 360p    | 5-15MB                      | Basic |
| Audio   | 3-8MB                       | MP3 only |

## 🎯 Quality Optimization Tips:

### For Consistent High Quality:
1. Always use "🔴 Best Available" setting
2. Check if the YouTube video actually has high quality (look at YouTube's quality selector)
3. Avoid downloading during peak hours when YouTube limits quality

### For Space Management:
1. Use "🟠 High Quality (720p)" for a good balance
2. Use "🟡 Standard Quality (480p)" for longer videos
3. Use "🎵 Audio Only" for music you only want to listen to

### For Troubleshooting Low Quality:
1. **Check the original video on YouTube** - Go to the video and see what qualities are available in YouTube's settings
2. **Try different time of day** - YouTube sometimes limits quality during peak hours
3. **Use cookies** - Logged-in users sometimes get better quality access
4. **Check your internet connection** - Slow connections may get lower quality

## 🔍 How to Check if a Video Has High Quality:

1. **On YouTube:** Click the gear icon → Quality → See available options
2. **In our app:** The video info will show available qualities
3. **File size indicator:** 
   - Very small files (< 5MB) = Low quality or audio-only
   - Medium files (10-30MB) = Good quality
   - Large files (50MB+) = High quality or long videos

## ⚡ Quick Fixes:

**If all downloads are low quality:**
- ✅ Update your yt-dlp version
- ✅ Clear cookies and try again  
- ✅ Try downloading at different times
- ✅ Use VPN if in restricted region

**If specific videos are low quality:**
- ✅ Check the video on YouTube first
- ✅ Try "Best Available" setting
- ✅ The video might only be available in that quality

**Remember:** Not all YouTube videos are available in high quality. The downloader can only download what YouTube makes available!
