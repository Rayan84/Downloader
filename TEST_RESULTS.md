## 🔍 **DOWNLOAD ISSUES & SOLUTIONS**

### ❌ "Downloaded file is empty" Error

**What it means:**
- YouTube is actively blocking the download request
- The video may be region-restricted or require sign-in
- Anti-bot measures are detecting automated downloads

**✅ Solutions Implemented:**

1. **Multiple Client Fallback Strategy:**
   - Primary: Multiple clients (android, web, ios, mweb)
   - Fallback 1: Android client only (usually works)
   - Fallback 2: Web client with cookies
   - Fallback 3: iOS client (last resort)

2. **Enhanced Headers & Bypassing:**
   - Updated User-Agent strings
   - Better cookie handling
   - Geo-bypass options
   - Rate limiting protection

3. **Format Fallbacks:**
   - If 4K fails, try 720p
   - If HD fails, try 480p
   - Progressive quality reduction

4. **Better Error Messages:**
   - Specific guidance for different error types
   - Clear instructions for users
   - Troubleshooting suggestions

### 🔧 **Troubleshooting Steps:**

1. **Try the test video first** (built into web interface)
2. **Wait 5-10 minutes** between failed attempts
3. **Use fresh cookies** if available
4. **Try different quality settings** (start with "worst" quality)
5. **Check if video is region-restricted**

## 🔍 **PARTIAL DOWNLOAD FILES ISSUE**

### What are .part, .ytdl files?

- **`.part` files**: Incomplete downloads that were interrupted
- **`.part-Frag*.part` files**: Fragment files from segmented streams
- **`.ytdl` files**: Resume metadata files from yt-dlp

### Why this happens:

1. Network interruptions during download
2. YouTube throttling/blocking
3. Server timeouts
4. FFmpeg merge process interruptions

### ✅ Solution Applied:

- Added automatic cleanup function in Flask app
- Improved error handling and retry logic
- Better partial file management
- Enhanced download recovery
